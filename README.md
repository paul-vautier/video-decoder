# Terminal Greyscale image decoder

Trial project to use rust FFMPEG bindings to print /dev/video0 output to the terminal.


The setup code for retrieving the video output is mostly inspired from the [official ffmpeg documentation](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/doc/examples/decode_filter_video.c)


## Requirements
- FFMPEG development libraries


## Installation 

```
cargo run
```
